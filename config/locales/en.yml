    h3_1: "1.The utmost good faith principle:"
    p_1: "All business transactions should be conducted on the basis of mutual trust and absolute honesty. Both the insured and the insured must be honest in all matters relating to entering into an insurance contract."
    h4_1: "1.1.For insurance participants"
    p_2: "It is the duty to fully and accurately declare all important factors involved, whether required or not. The purpose of the principle of absolute honesty is to reduce the cost of risk assessment and the liability binding of the insured. According to this principle, the party who knows important information related to the insurance policy for which he / she participates must notify the partner of that information. The scope of the principle applies to both insurance companies and insurance participants."
    p_3: "Some notes:"
    p_4: "(1)An important factor is any factor that affects the acceptance of insurance and settlement of insurance benefits. For example: The insured's habit of drinking alcohol. That habit is an important factor for the insurance company that accepts his body, life, sickness insurance and motor vehicle insurance under his control. Some important factors in types of insurance:"
    p_5: "-For home insurance: What kind of materials, building materials, how to design, where the house was built, ..."
    p_6: "-For human insurance: age, occupation, medical history of the insured, health records of family members, ..."
    p_7: "-For auto insurance: Used time of vehicle, driving age, accident history, ..."
    p_8: "(2)Disclosure obligation: Generally, claimants must declare important elements when requesting insurance. The declaration must be completed before the insurance contract is signed. When the insured person deliberately fails to fully declare important elements, he / she is considered to violate the principle of absolute honesty and the insurance contract may be partially or wholly canceled."
    h4_2: "1.2.For insurance companies"
    p_9: "The principle of absolute honesty in insurance not only applies to the insured, but the law requires the insurance company when dealing or introducing to offer insurance operations to customers. obligations and principles. Insurance companies through their operators or agents shall be responsible for providing complete and accurate information related to insurance contracts such as insurance benefits, insurance premiums, insurance sums. , explain terms, answer questions for the insured. The insurance company intentionally provides false information to enter into an insurance contract, the insured has the right to unilaterally suspend the performance of the insurance contract, the insurance company must compensate for damages arising from his mistake."
    h3_2: "2.Principles of insurable interest:"
    p_10: "Benefits that can be insured are benefits or benefits related to, attached to, or subject to the safety or insecurity of the subject matter insured. This principle states that the insured who wants to buy insurance must have insurance benefits. Benefits that can be insured may be benefits that already exist or will be included in the subject of insurance. Benefits that can be insured are the right to own, to possess, to use the property; rights and obligations of nurturing and supporting the insured. Specifically:"
    p_11: "For non-life insurance:"
    p_12: "-In property insurance, the insurance buyer has a number of contacts with the subject of insurance legally recognized. The first relationship recognized by law is: the owner. The second connection is the rights and responsibilities before the property. For example, a person has insurance benefits for items he or she borrowed because if they are lost or damaged, he or she will have to perform replacement, repair, reimbursement or restoration."
    p_13: "-In civil liability insurance: insurance benefits must be based on the provisions of the law on binding civil liability."
    p_14: "For life insurance:"
    p_15: "From the new point of view of benefits that can be insured in life insurance, the most common way to understand: Insurable benefits is the relationship between the insurance buyer and the insured. In particular, the risk that occurs to the assured will cause loss, financial or mental damage to the insurance buyer. It can be seen that: Every individual has unlimited insurance benefits for his or her own life, so they can insure their life with whatever value they want, as long as they have enough. Premiums. Insurance benefits also exist for his / her parent, spouse, children, siblings or persons who have legal custody or guardianship. An insurable benefit also exists for an insurance purchaser being an organization in the following cases: An organization purchases insurance for employees working for that organization; credit institutions and banks shall buy insurance for customers who borrow money from such banks and credit institutions."
    p_16: "To ensure this principle, before issuing an insurance contract, the insurance company must check between the insured and the subject matter insured that the insurance may exist in principle and according to the rules. of the insurance contract or not."
    h3_3: "3.The principle of the majority (the law of large numbers)"
    p_17: "According to this rule, if doing research on a sufficiently large number of subjects, one will calculate the relatively accurate probability of the actual occurrence of an event."
    p_18: "The law of large numbers is an important scientific basis of insurance. This law helps the Insurance Company to estimate the probability of accepting insurance, in order to help calculate and manage the reserve funds paid, because : The insurance company only guarantees for accidental incidents, if calculated individually, the insurance may be like a game of chance; but on a large number of insured subjects, insurance companies can predict the likelihood of the incident at a relatively acceptable level of accuracy."
    p_19: "The law of large numbers is applicable only when:"
    p_20: "-Large number of similar risks and losses: The observation must be conducted on a large number, at the same time must be based on the risk grouping, grouping of insurance subjects according to appropriate criteria. For example, to calculate damage to human bodily injury due to an accident, one observes a large number of accidents that occur, causing damage to human health and over a period of time ( usually a year)"
    p_21: "-The risk of loss must be independent: The occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not change the possibility of another."
    h3_4: "4.Principles of indemnity:"
    p_22: "According to the principle of compensation, when a loss occurs, the insurer must compensate in some way to ensure that the insured has the same primary position as before the loss occurred, no more and no less The parties are not entitled to take advantage of insurance for self-seeking purposes.The purpose of the indemnity principle is to restore a part or all of the financial status as before the loss of the insured. to ensure that the insured person is unable to receive a payment greater than the value of the loss they incur, and that the indemnity liability of the insurance company also arises only when there is damage caused by the insured risk. The principle of compensation applies only to two types of insurance, property insurance and civil liability insurance, not to life insurance and human insurance operations."
    p_23: "Some cases to note:"
    p_24: "-In accordance with this principle, in the event that the insured receives compensation from various insurance contracts, whether from different insurance companies or of the same insurance company, the total sum The indemnity of all insurance contracts will not exceed the value of the loss."
    p_25: "-Where the insured is also compensated by a third party. For example, receiving compensation from the automobile driver who hit him. At that time, the total amount of the indemnity of the party Thirdly, and the insurer does not exceed the value of the loss suffered by the assured.If the insured has received the indemnity from the insurer, the assured is obliged to reserve. and transfer the right of third party claim to the insurance company."
    h4_3: "4.1.The principle of subrogation:"
    p_26: "According to the principle of subrogation, the insurer, after compensation for the assured, has the right to act on his behalf to claim the third party's liability for compensation. In damage insurance, the principle of compensation It is determined that the insured cannot receive more compensation than the damage they suffer.Example: 4-seat passenger car is properly insured, hit by a truck and damaged. It must be repaired and replaced as before the accident and is compensated by the insurance company with the insurance amount of VND 35,000,000. The traffic police fault identifies the truck is 70% and the car is 30%. , the insurer has fulfilled its commitment to the assured to indemnify the right of the loss.After receiving full indemnity, the assured must reserve the right to reclaim the liability of the insured party. third (in the example above is the truck) to the insurance company."
    p_27: "Therefore, the right to claim the reimbursement is the principle by which: After compensation for the insured the other party (the 3rd party) is responsible for such costs and losses, the insurer will be entitled to all legal rights of the insured to reduce losses. The principle of subrogation does not apply to human insurance."
    h4_4: "4.2.Principles of contribution of losses"
    p_28: "This is also a very important principle that requires the insurer and the insured to understand and act properly; to avoid the insurable insured in the insurance and the insurer being lost when indemnified. often the amount exceeds the actual responsibility we incur according to our commitment."
    p_29: "The principle of contribution stipulates: when an object is insured by many insurance companies - it suffers loss, the insurance companies will be obliged to contribute compensation according to the proportion of the liability they have received. . This principle does not apply to human insurance contracts."
    h3_5: "5.Principles of contracting"
    p_30: "Presumptive principle is a principle commonly applied to the settlement of insurance interests in human insurance contracts in general and life insurance in particular. According to the presumption principle, when insurance events occur, The insurance company, based on the sum insured of the signed contract and the provisions agreed in the contract to pay the beneficiary, is not for compensation purposes but only for damages. quality of contractual commitments according to the prescribed contracting level."
    p_31: "Note:"
    p_32: "-The sum paid by the insurance company is not to pay damages, but to fulfill the commitment in the insurance contract with the insurance purchaser."
    p_33: "-The insured at the same time has the right to receive insurance benefits from many different personal insurance contracts."
    h3_6: "6.Principle of near cause"
    p_34: "The near cause is the proactive, effective and dominant cause of the loss or damage to the subject-matter insured. The near cause is not necessarily the first or the cause. The last cause that is the dominant cause, the proactive cause of the loss.If there are effects of some causes, the `` near cause '' will be the dominant or the most powerful cause. In the valid term of an insurance policy, the insured subject to the risks of loss, but losses occur due to many reasons, including excluded cause is not covered by insurance. So it is important to determine whether the cause is covered by insurance."
    p_35: "Apply cause close:"
    p_36: "-Simultaneous causes: When there are two or more simultaneous events including the insured event and the independent loss, the insurance company will be responsible for the loss due to However, if the loss cannot be categorized, the insurer will be liable for all losses."
    p_37: "-Series of continuous events : When a series of consecutive events occurs, the insurer will be responsible for the first loss caused by the risk insured in the contract, provided there is no which exclusion risk occurs before the insured risk."
    p_38: "For example:"
    p_39: "+In case of no risk of exclusion: A person who is covered by insurance while crossing the road is run over by a car and dies. insurance benefit settlement."
    p_40: "+Where there is a risk of exclusion: An ammonia gas cylinder used for welding explodes and catches fire to a motorbike repair shop. This store and its contents are covered in the fire insurance is used for commercial purposes (not for domestic use), so the explosion is an exclusion risk. In the event of a fire (insured risk), the insurance company will not be responsible for any loss caused by the fire. After the fire happens, the insurer will be responsible for the fire damage before the explosion."
    p_41: "-Series of interrupted events: When there is a sequence of interrupted events, the nearest cause of loss is the cause immediately after the last interruption. For example: The insured enters into a contract. During a boat trip across a river, he unfortunately fell into the river.At the same time, he suffered a heart attack and later drowned. drowning is the nearest cause, not a heart attack, because there is an interruption in the series of incidents between a heart attack and drowning. The insurer will be responsible for payment of benefits that this person is entitled to. under a personal accident insurance contract."
